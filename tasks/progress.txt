Task completed: Fixed PrismaClient initialization and Middleware deprecation warning.
Key decisions:
- Downgraded Next.js to 15.1.6 and Prisma to 6.3.1 for stability.
- Split Auth.js config into auth.config.ts (edge-compatible) and auth.ts (full) to fix Edge runtime issues in middleware.
- Fixed Tailwind 4 PostCSS integration by installing @tailwindcss/postcss.
- Restored middleware.ts from proxy.ts after the Next.js downgrade.
- Updated scripts/check.sh to allow next-auth beta and perform more robust checks.
Notes for next run: Backlog is fully cleared.
