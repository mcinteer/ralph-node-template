# Specifications

This directory contains Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) and technical
specifications for the project.

## How to write specs

1. **Goal**: Clearly define what we are trying to achieve.
2. **Proposed Structure**: Map out the directory and file changes.
3. **Implementation Details**: Break down the technical steps and logic.
4. **Acceptance Criteria**: List the conditions that must be met for the task
   to be considered complete.

Use sequential numbering for specs (e.g., `001-feature.md`,
`002-another-feature.md`).
