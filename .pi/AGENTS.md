# Agent Instructions

## Engineering Standards
- This codebase will outlive you. Fight entropy. Leave it better than you found it.
- Prioritize architectural decisions and integration points over polish.
- Write production-ready, maintainable code.
- Every change should be a small, logical step with a clear purpose.

## Workflow
- Always refer to `specs/` for requirements.
- Update `tasks/backlog.md` and `tasks/progress.txt` regularly.
- Run `scripts/lint.sh` before committing changes.
- If a task is too large, break it down into smaller, manageable sub-tasks.
